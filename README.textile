h1. Introduction

This code is derived from "gdata-scala":http://code.google.com/p/gdata-scala-client/

The following modifications were applied:
# Use Scala 2.8.1
# Use Java DOM rather than SAX xml processing
# Remove constructs that were useful for original purpose but not generally applicable
# Support for additional XML structures
# More tests

h1. Documentation

The "original documentation":http://code.google.com/p/gdata-scala-client/wiki/DevelopersGuide 
is still relevant and very helpful to understand the core principles. "ticket508":http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/508
is no longer a concern.

The Java DOM provides zero-cost interoperability with the wider Java ecosystem.
